# ðŸ“¡ Radio Link Frequency Assignment Problem (RLFAP)

The Radio Link Frequency Assignment Problem is a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) which consists of assigning frequencies to a set of radio links defined between pairs of sites in order to avoid interferences.  
Extensive description of the problem can be found [here](https://miat.inrae.fr/schiex/rlfap.shtml).

## Search methods used:
- Backtracking with Forward Checking (FC)
- Backtracking with Maintaining Arc Consistency (MAC)
- Forward Checking with Conflict-directed BackJumping hybrid (FC-CBJ)
- Min Conflicts

---

## Use of heuristics:
To speed up the search, a conflict-directed variable ordering heuristic like *dom/wdeg heuristic* is used.  
This heuristic significantly reduces search time from several hours to only a few seconds.  
It is utilized in all methods listed above during the search.  

Reference to the related paper about the *dom/wdeg heuristic* is included below.
